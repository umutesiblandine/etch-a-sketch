Etch-a-Sketch
This project displays a 16 by 16 grid by default. And it has a button that you can click and be able
to input a desired number of squares by side and previous grid display will be erased and a new grid
will be generated with the input number in the same amount of space decided by default.

When hovering over a grid div the background color changes to a random color using random rgb values.
with each hover reduces the amount of the div's color by 10 percent. and after a particular div is been passed over ten times
its background color will be black. And if we pass over all of the div times the result will be a completely black box of
size of that of the container div.
